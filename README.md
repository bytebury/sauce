# sauce üçÖ
A functional base layer for any size application to help get you write cleaner code.
We provide several small every-day helper functions that are easy to use. In addition,
we offer the `Option` pattern that Rust uses, for clear, safe null-checks.

## Installation
```sh
npm i --save @bytebury/sauce
```

## Usage
```ts
import { title, sample, wrap, isWhitespace } from "@bytebury/sauce";
import { type Option } from "@bytebury/sauce";

function sayHelloTo(name: Option<string>): void {
  if (name.isNoneOr(isWhitespace)) {
    console.log('Hello, Guest!');
    return;
  }
  console.log(`Hello, ${title(name))}`);
}
```

## How Sauce Works
Sauce provides several helper functions that are useful for any size application.
It has zero dependencies and a small footprint. We also offer `Option` which is
inspired by **[Rust](https://rust-lang.org)**. It helps avoid Null-pointer Exceptions,
and TypeScript does its best to not allow you to hurt yourself at compile time.

When you call any _string or number function_ in Sauce, you will never experience
a NullException. We will always default a value if null or undefined is given
_or_ if we cannot return a default value, we will return an `Option<T>`.

In Sauce, we have `Some` and `None` which are exported by Sauce. As the name implies,
`Some` represents a thing that has a value. `None` represents a thing without a value.
In our case, `None === (null || undefined)`. Therefore, you can create an option three ways:

```ts
// via `Some` - creates an `Option` with the value given wrapped.
const option1 = Some("123");
// via `None` - creates an `Option` with no value (`None`).
const option2 = None;
// via `wrap()` - converts any value to an `Option`.
const option3 = wrap(couldBeAnything);
```

Take for example this code:

```ts
// ‚ö†Ô∏è this might throw an exception if value is null!
function lowerCaseValue(value: string): string {
  return value.toLowerCase();
}

// So instead, to be safe:
function lowerCaseValue(value: string): string {
  if (value === undefined || value === null) {
    return '';
  }
  return value.toLowerCase();
}

// But, we can use Option instead!
function lowerCaseValue(value: Option<string>): string {
  return lower(value.unwrapOr(''));
}
```

There's a lot of other functions that help do things on `Option`, like
`isNoneOr` and `isSomeAnd`. For example take this code:

```ts
// ‚ö†Ô∏è this might throw an exception if value is null!
function sayHello(name: string): void {
  if (name === undefined || name === null || name.trim().length === 0 {
    console.log('Hello, Guest!');
  } else {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
  }
}

// However, we can clean this up with sauce üçÖ
function sayHello(name: Option<string>): void {
  if (name.isNoneOr(isWhitespace)) {
    console.log('Hello, Guest!');
  } else {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
  }
}
```

We also introduce types to be more explicit in our intentions, these are minor
tweaks to our code, but they really help the future developers.

```ts
// You might often see this:
setTimeout(() => { /* omit */}, 1_800_000);  // ‚ö†Ô∏è we'd have to think about this...

// Instead, we offer the `Duration` object:
setTimeout(() => { /* omit */}, Duration.minutes(30)); // ‚úÖ readable
```

Sauce also supplies types that every application can benefit from. You can read
about all of the types that we [export here](https://sauce.pizzastate.dev/modules/types.html).
It includes types like: `Autocomplete`, `UnknownRecord`, `UnknownList`, `OneOrMany`, `NonEmptyList` and more.

## Inspiration
At Bytebury, we use Rust extensively and appreciate how elegantly it handles null values.
TypeScript has `null` and `undefined`, but all too often we find ourselves writing 
repetitive null-checks or worse, discovering null-related errors only at runtime. We think that
TypeScript can benefit from the `Option` pattern that Rust provides. We acknowledge it's not
fool-proof. However, it's made development enjoyable, explicit, and efficient in TypeScript.

We've also included some functions that we personally use all the time, and therefore, that's
included in the library. If you want to use Sauce, and we're missing a function that you
find useful, please feel free to contribute back to the project.
